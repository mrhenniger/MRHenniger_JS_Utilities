# MRHenniger_JS_Utilities
 Utilities for HTML/CSS/JS written by Mike R Henniger

This is a collection of utilities written my Mike Henniger to make working with vanilla JS and avoid bloated frame works 
with frequent updates which make hobby projects difficult to keep current.

I originally wrote some of these utilities in JavaScript (see some files with _Original in the name), but this seemed a 
good project with which to build my TypeScript chops. So I am refactoring EVERYTHING.  This is a work in progress.

I would be interested to hear what you have to say about what you see here.  Constructive criticism is always well 
received.

Revision log...

V2 - September 29 - Added the new classes Dom and DomCollection with aid in the manipulation of the dom.  These 
                    utilities are intended to be a lightweight alternative to the JQuery library.  There isn't too much
                    to them yet, but they have been proven useful in another project.  I expect to develop them both 
                    further.  Look for the tests in test_dom.html for examples of how these utility classes may be used.

V1 - September 15 - First draft of the TypeScript version of my Strings class in strings.js.  Look for the tests in 
                    test_strings.html for examples of how these string utilities may be used.

V0 - September 13 - Just getting the original JS files under source control.  They won't make much sense without the 
                    tests to go with them.
