# MRHenniger_JS_Utilities
 Utilities for HTML/CSS/JS written by Mike R Henniger

This is a collection of utilities written my Mike Henniger to make working with vanilla JS and avoid bloated frame works with frequent updates which make hobby project hard to keep current.

I originally wrote some of these utilities in JavaScript (see some files with _Original in the name), but this seemed a good project with which to build my TypeScript chops. So I am refactoring EVERYTHING.  This is a work in progress.

I would be interested to hear what you have to say about what you see here.  Constructive criticism is always well received.

Regards,
Mike Henniger

Revision log...

V0 - September 13 - Just getting the original JS files under source control.  They won't make much sense without the tests to go with them.
